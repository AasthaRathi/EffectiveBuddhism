            <h2>Thesis:</h2>
            <p>
              Buddhism is an amazing philosophy full of wisdom with great
              truths, however I believe Buddhists have lost the way of the
              Buddha and lack a real basis of impact. Effective Buddhism is a
              solution to those who seek to follow the Buddhist Path as Buddha
              Wanted. If Buddha was alive today, imagine the amount of change
              and impact he would be having.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h2>Evidence:</h2>
            <p>
              In current Buddhist society, the top Buddhist role models have
              iron wills, but lack real ACTION or PURPOSE behind this because of
              a misinterpretation of Dharma. Buddha’s four main vows tell a
              different story of how the Buddha should act.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              The Bodhisattva Vows exist in many different forms; they are
              chanted as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Creations are numberless, I vow to free them.</li>
              <li>Delusions are inexhaustible, I vow to transform them.</li>
              <li>Reality is boundless, I vow to perceive it.</li>
              <li>The awakened way is unsurpassable, I vow to embody it.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>It’s also said in this way.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Living beings are limitless, I vow to liberate them all.</li>
              <li>Blind passions are limitless, I vow to sever them all.</li>
              <li>Dharma gates are inexhaustible, I vow to know them all.</li>
              <li>Unsurpassed is awakening, I vow to realize it.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Or, in the most laymen terms:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>To save all people</li>
              <li>To renounce all worldly desires</li>
              <li>o learn all teachings</li>
              <li>To attain perfect enlightenment</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              If you go searching, there are many other ways these four vows are
              written, but they are all telling the same thing, in this order.
            </p>
            <p>
              As anyone may observe from the outside, the most influential
              people in the world today are not Buddhists. On top of that anyone
              from a Non-Buddhist city, will tell you that they have not heard
              from a Buddhist about why that path is best.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a sickness is the Buddha communities today to ignore the
              first vow, and try to move on to 2,3, and 4. By the very means of
              the vows, step 2 cannot be done without first completing step 1.
              Step 1 is in fact, an earthly desire. The Four Main Vows are a
              harmonious right of passage that must be balanced in action
              towards their completion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, the way of the Buddha should be to renounce all worldly
              desires IN ORDER TO save all people, and to learn all teachings IN
              ORDER TO save all people, and that once these steps are completed
              perfect enlightenment will be attained. This means that these
              tasks are in harmony. As one renounces more wordy desires to spend
              more time saving people, one learns teachings to improve how they
              go about saving others, and rides the collective path towards
              enlightenment.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, instead of following this path and order, Buddhists today
              are known as people continually meditating. Struggling to awaken
              and renounce all worldly desires, and instead all acting to each
              other like they are farther along the path. I believe Buddhism has
              become a sick game of ineffective spiritual ego stroking.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not saying that the Men and Women who have become great at
              meditating for hours and wholly living a minimalist life have not
              gone further down their path of enlightenment, instead that it is
              very sad that so much potential is moving towards the wrong place
              for the world to awaken and be saved. It is a fact these people
              who realize their potential to follow the first vow will be some
              of the strongest Buddhas there are.
            </p>
            <p>
              The funny thing about tech entrepreneurs who are rapidly changing
              the future, and Buddhism is that these tech entrepreneurs are
              slowly learning the way of the Buddha in order to optimize
              themselves. They are reaching new paths of enlightenment. Instead
              of referring to their actions as the Buddha way, they are learning
              the teachings of Buddha in order to be more effective.
            </p>
            <p>A few examples of parallel movements to the 10 precepts are:</p>
            <p>
              Not to engage in licentious acts or encourage others to do so. A
              monk is expected to abstain from sexual conduct entirely. <br />
              Not to use false words and speech, or encourage others to do so.
              <br />
              Not to trade or sell alcoholic beverages or encourage others to do
              so. <br />
              Not to harbor anger or encourage others to be angry. -

                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha shall not himself kill, encourage
                    others to kill, kill by expedient means, praise killing,
                    rejoice at witnessing killing, or kill through incantation
                    or deviant mantras. He must not create the causes,
                    conditions, methods, or karma of killing, and shall not
                    intentionally kill any living creature. As a Buddha's
                    disciple, he ought to nurture a mind of compassion
                    and filial piety, always devising expedient means to rescue
                    and protect all beings. If instead, he fails to restrain
                    himself and kills sentient beings without mercy, he commits
                    a Parajika (major) offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha must not himself steal or encourage
                    others to steal, steal by expedient means, steal by means of
                    incantation or deviant mantras. He should not create the
                    causes, conditions, methods, or karma of stealing. No
                    valuables or possessions, even those belonging to ghosts and
                    spirits or thieves and robbers, be they as small as a needle
                    or blade of grass, may be stolen. As a Buddha's disciple, he
                    ought to have a mind of mercy, compassion, and filial piety
                    -- always helping people earn merits and achieve happiness.
                    If instead, he steals the possessions of others, he commits
                    a Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha must not engage in licentious acts
                    or encourage others to do so. [As a monk] he should not have
                    sexual relations with any female -- be she a human, animal,
                    deity or spirit -- nor create the causes, conditions,
                    methods, or karma of such misconduct. Indeed, he must not
                    engage in improper sexual conduct with anyone. A Buddha's
                    disciple ought to have a mind of filial piety -- rescuing
                    all sentient beings and instructing them in the Dharma of
                    purity and chastity. If instead, he lacks compassion and
                    encourages others to engage in sexual relations
                    promiscuously, including with animals and even their
                    mothers, daughters, sisters, or other close relatives, he
                    commits a Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha must not himself use false words
                    and speech, or encourage others to lie or lie by expedient
                    means. He should not involve himself in the causes,
                    conditions, methods, or karma of lying, saying that he has
                    seen what he has not seen or vice versa, or lying implicitly
                    through physical or mental means. As a Buddha's disciple, he
                    ought to maintain Right Speech and Right Views always, and
                    lead all others to maintain them as well. If instead, he
                    causes wrong speech, wrong views or evil karma in others, he
                    commits a Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha must not trade in alcoholic
                    beverages or encourage others to do so. He should not create
                    the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of selling any
                    intoxicant whatsoever, for intoxicants are the causes and
                    conditions of all kinds of offenses. As a Buddha's disciple,
                    he ought to help all sentient beings achieve clear wisdom.
                    If instead, he causes them to have upside-down, topsy-turvy
                    thinking, he commits a Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha must not himself broadcast the
                    misdeeds or infractions of Bodhisattva-clerics or
                    Bodhisattva-laypersons, or of [ordinary] monks and nuns --
                    nor encourage others to do so. He must not create the
                    causes, conditions, methods, or karma of discussing the
                    offenses of the assembly. As a Buddha's disciple, whenever
                    he hears evil persons, externalists or followers of the Two
                    Vehicles speak of practices contrary to the Dharma or
                    contrary to the precepts within the Buddhist community, he
                    should instruct them with a compassionate mind and lead them
                    to develop wholesome faith in the Mahayana. If instead, he
                    discusses the faults and misdeeds that occur within the
                    assembly, he commits a Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha shall not praise himself and speak
                    ill of others, or encourage others to do so. He must not
                    create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of praising
                    himself and disparaging others. As a disciple of the Buddha,
                    he should be willing to stand in for all sentient beings and
                    endure humiliation and slander -- accepting blame and
                    letting sentient beings have all the glory. If instead, he
                    displays his own virtues and conceals the good points of
                    others, thus causing them to suffer slander, he commits a
                    Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha must not be stingy or encourage
                    others to be stingy. He should not create the causes,
                    conditions, methods, or karma of stinginess. As a
                    Bodhisattva, whenever a destitute person comes for help, he
                    should give that person what he needs. If instead, out of
                    anger and resentment, he denies all assistance -- refusing
                    to help with even a penny, a needle, a blade of grass, even
                    a single sentence or verse or a phrase of Dharma, but
                    instead scolds and abuses that person -- he commits a
                    Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A disciple of the Buddha shall not harbor anger or encourage
                    others to be angry. He should not create the causes,
                    conditions, methods, or karma of anger. As a disciple of the
                    Buddha, he ought to be compassionate and filial, helping all
                    sentient beings develop the good roots of non-contention. If
                    instead, he insults and abuses sentient beings, or even
                    transformation beings [such as deities and spirits], with
                    harsh words, hitting them with his fists or feet, or
                    attacking them with a knife or club -- or harbors grudges
                    even when the victim confesses his mistakes and humbly seeks
                    forgiveness in a soft, conciliatory voice -- the disciple
                    commits a Parajika offense.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A Buddha's disciple shall not himself speak ill of the
                    Triple Jewel or encourage others to do so. He must not
                    create the causes, conditions, methods or karma of slander.
                    If a disciple hears but a single word of slander against the
                    Buddha from externalists or evil beings, he experiences a
                    pain similar to that of three hundred spears piercing his
                    heart. How then could he possibly slander the Triple Jewel
                    himself? Hence, if a disciple lacks faith and filial piety
                    towards the Triple Jewel, and even assists evil persons or
                    those of aberrant views to slander the Triple Jewel, he
                    commits a Parajika offense.

            <h2>Reiterating The Message:</h2>
            <p>
              Many buddhists today practice the seeking of enlightenment rather
              than practicing the way of Buddha himself. Buddha was an
              enlightened being who spread his philosophy far and wide,
              preaching and changing and influencing the world and his actions
              live on to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Buddhists in most countries are seen as people who simply
              meditate. The idea is to relinquish attachment to earthly desires
              in order to DO MORE. Not to meditate all day to do nothing. In an
              effort of learning all teachings, we will re-evaluate the core
              values, and give a new perspective based on the teachings. The
              core re-evaluation leads us to the idea that Nirvana is something
              to achieve in this realm. And that leaving this realm is a
              negative desire in it of itself.
            </p>
            <p>Let’s break them down.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                To save all people: this is by far the biggest vow that is
                failed to be recognized by modern Buddhist society. Outreach is
                a non-factor. So many people who need this valuable information
                are left in the dark, with no outreach from Buddhists. Actual
                progress using technology (tools to increase impact) are
                completely disregarded.
              </li>
              <li>
                Many people have regarded this initial vow as meaning to
                renounce. But here’s what the true text says “
                <b>Desires</b> for tangible things (such as wealth, property, or
                other material goods) or for pleasures of the body (such as
                sexual activity, gluttony, or other hedonistic pursuits).
                Buddhism teaches us to try to let go of our
                <b>worldly desires</b> , freeing our minds and bodies for a
                state of enlightenment.”As it says, freeing our minds and bodies
                for a state of enlightenment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Learning all teachings requires knowing all things, we do not
                even know how consciousness works yet. To learn all teachings,
                we need to learn by the act of doing. There is no better thing
                to learn at this time, than how to spread change like Buddha
                did.
              </li>
              <li>
                “In <b>Buddhism, enlightenment</b> (called bodhi in Indian
                <b>Buddhism</b> , or satori in Zen <b>Buddhism</b> ) is when a
                <b>Buddhist</b> finds the truth about life and stops being
                reborn because they have reached Nirvana.” In order to stop the
                cycle of rebirth, we must stop the death to life cycle. With
                infinite time our particles are always brought back to a
                conscious form. Until we find a conscious form to reach Nirvana
                in, we will repeat the cycle. “<b>Rebirth</b> in
                <a href="">Buddhism</a> refers to its teaching that the actions
                of a person lead to a new existence after death, in an endless
                cycle called <a href="">saṃsāra</a>.[1][2] This cycle is
                considered to be <a href="">dukkha</a> , unsatisfactory and
                painful. The cycle stops only if <a href="">liberation</a> is
                achieved by <a href="">insight</a> and the
                <a href="">extinguishing of craving</a> .

                This is another in my series of discussions of ideas Stephen
                Batchelor has been presenting in dharma talks since late 2010.
                You can hear them at dharmaseed.org. One of the attractive ideas
                to come out of Stephen Batchelor’s recent teaching is a mapping
                of the Four Noble Truths onto the Four Bodhisattva Vows of the
                Zen tradition, a concept Batchelor got from former Zen priest
                and current Vipassana teacher Gil Fronsdal.
